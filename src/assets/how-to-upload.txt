HOW TO UPLOAD:
(Step-By-Step Process Of Making Money Fast)

1. Import .jpg pictures into the Upload folder (here).
2. Import the minified .jpg pictures using "min-" before the name
(I use photoshop export for web and set the image size percent to 5%)
(Further investigation for best efficiency is needed).
3. Run the upload.bash script by opening the cmd line and typing ./upload.bash
(WINDOWS TIP: Press SHIFT + Right Mouse Click and select the Command Prompt option).
4. After you finish up with the script, go to the folder into which you have uploaded
new pictures. Open the order.csv file with Excel and move the name into the column
you want your new picture to be in.
